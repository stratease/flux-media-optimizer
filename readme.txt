== Frequently Asked Questions ==

= Does this plugin work with any WordPress theme? =

Yes, Flux Media Optimizer works with any WordPress theme. It integrates seamlessly with WordPress's image rendering system and doesn't require any theme modifications.

= What image and video formats are supported? =

The plugin supports converting JPEG, PNG, and GIF images to WebP and AVIF formats. For videos, it converts to optimized MP4 and WebM formats. It automatically detects which formats your server supports and uses the best available option. Note: Animated GIF support requires the Imagick extension - GD cannot preserve animation.

= How much space will I save? =

Most users see 50-70% reduction in image file sizes and significant savings on videos. The exact savings depend on your original media, but WebP typically saves 25-35% and AVIF can save 50-70% compared to JPEG. Video compression savings vary based on your quality and bitrate settings.

= Will this affect my site's SEO? =

Yes, in a positive way! Faster loading images improve your Core Web Vitals scores, which Google uses as a ranking factor. You'll likely see improvements in your Google PageSpeed Insights scores.

= Do I need to configure anything? =

No, Flux Media Optimizer works out of the box with sensible defaults. You can optionally adjust quality settings for images and bitrate/preset settings for videos, but the plugin will start optimizing images and videos immediately after activation.

= Is my data secure? =

Yes, by default all processing happens locally on your server. Your media files never leave your WordPress installation unless you explicitly opt-in to external processing services.


= Does this work with existing images and videos? =

Yes! Flux Media Optimizer can bulk process all your existing images and videos. Just go to the settings page and enable "Bulk Convert" to optimize your entire media library with WP Cron.

= Will this break my existing images or videos? =

No, Flux Media Optimizer creates new optimized versions while keeping your original media files as fallbacks. If anything goes wrong, your original images and videos remain untouched.

= What if my server doesn't support WebP or AVIF? =

Flux Media Optimizer automatically detects your server's capabilities and only creates formats that are supported. If your server doesn't support modern formats, the plugin will gracefully fall back to your original images.

= Can I convert animated GIFs? =

Yes! Flux Media Optimizer supports both static and animated GIFs. However, animated GIF conversion requires the Imagick PHP extension. GD cannot preserve animation, so if you only have GD available, animated GIFs will be converted but will lose their animation. The plugin will automatically use Imagick when available for animated GIFs.
