## 🚀 Key Features

### Image Optimization
- **Hybrid Approach**: Creates both WebP and AVIF formats for optimal performance
- **Smart Serving**: Uses `<picture>` tags or direct URL replacement based on settings
- **Quality Control**: Configurable quality settings with version-specific AVIF optimization
- **Automatic Processing**: Convert on upload and bulk process existing media
- **WordPress Integration**: Seamless integration with Gutenberg blocks and responsive images
- **GIF Support**: Full support for static and animated GIFs with animation preservation (requires Imagick)

### Video Optimization
- **FFmpeg-Powered**: Uses PHP-FFmpeg for efficient MP4/WebM generation
- **Size & Quality Controls**: Configure bitrate and presets to balance clarity and savings
- **Bulk & On-Upload Support**: Convert existing library items or new uploads automatically

### Global CDN & Cloud Processing (SaaS)
- **Global Content Delivery**: Optimized assets are stored on Flux's Google Cloud CDN, ensuring lightning-fast delivery worldwide regardless of visitor location
- **Offloaded Processing**: Heavy image/video conversion tasks are handled by our external service, reducing load on your server
- **Automatic Upload & Optimization**: New uploads are automatically sent to our processing service and returned as optimized assets
- **Secure Integration**: Uses license key authentication and secure webhooks for reliable communication


## 💡 Optional External Services (Coming Soon)

All plugin features work fully without these services. These are optional enhancements for users who want to use external processing:

- **Optional cloud processing** - Offload heavy conversions to secure cloud infrastructure (all processing works locally by default)
- **Enhanced optimizations** - Optional servers with optimal image and video processing libraries
- **CDN integration** - Optional global content delivery for image serving
- **Priority support** - Optional support tier for external service users

## 🔒 Privacy & Data Protection

### Local Processing (Default)
- All image and video processing happens locally on your server
- No external data sharing without explicit consent
- Media files never leave your WordPress installation

### Optional SaaS Service
- Opt-in only with explicit user consent and license activation
- External processing via secure cloud infrastructure
- Optimized files are stored on Flux's Global Google Cloud CDN for performance
- Email communications for service updates and marketing
- Full compliance with WordPress.org guidelines

## 🛠️ Build Process

This plugin uses webpack to build JavaScript and CSS assets from source code.

### Source Code Location
- **JavaScript Source**: [`assets/js/src/`](https://github.com/stratease/flux-media-optimizer/tree/master/assets/js/src) - React components and application code
- **Build Output**: `assets/js/dist/` - Compiled and minified production bundles

### Third-Party Libraries
- [React](https://react.dev/) - UI framework
- [Material-UI (MUI)](https://mui.com/) - Component library
- [React Router](https://reactrouter.com/) - Routing
- [TanStack Query](https://tanstack.com/query) - Data fetching

### Build Tools
- **Build Tool**: webpack (configured in `package.json`)
- **Build Commands**:
  - `npm run build` - Production build (minified and optimized)
  - `npm run dev` - Development build with watch mode
  - `npm run start` - Development server with hot reload

### Building from Source
To build the plugin from source:

1. Install Node.js dependencies:
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

2. Build production assets:
   ```bash
   npm run build
   ```

3. For development with hot reload:
   ```bash
   npm run start
   ```

The source code is available in the GitHub repository: [https://github.com/stratease/flux-media-optimizer](https://github.com/stratease/flux-media-optimizer)

## 🛠️ Quick Start

### Installation
```bash
# Install PHP dependencies
composer install

# Install Node.js dependencies
npm install

# Build frontend
npm run build
```

### Development
```bash
# Frontend development with hot reload
npm run dev

# Run tests
./vendor/bin/phpunit
npm test

# Lint code
npm run lint
composer run lint
```

## 🏗️ Architecture

This plugin uses a modern, decoupled architecture that separates business logic from WordPress dependencies:

- **Pure Business Logic**: `ImageConverter` and `VideoConverter` are WordPress-independent
- **Provider Pattern**: `WordPressProvider` handles all WordPress integration
- **Dependency Injection**: Uses interfaces for testable, decoupled components
- **Unified Converter Interface**: Fluent API with centralized format constants
- **External Optimization**: `ExternalOptimizationProvider` manages communication with the SaaS processing service and CDN
