The plugin supports converting JPEG and PNG images to WebP and AVIF formats. It automatically detects which formats your server supports and uses the best available option.

= How much space will I save? =

Most users see 50-70% reduction in image file sizes. The exact savings depend on your original images, but WebP typically saves 25-35% and AVIF can save 50-70% compared to JPEG.

= Will this affect my site's SEO? =

Yes, in a positive way! Faster loading images improve your Core Web Vitals scores, which Google uses as a ranking factor. You'll likely see improvements in your Google PageSpeed Insights scores.

= Do I need to configure anything? =

No, Flux Media works out of the box with sensible defaults. You can optionally adjust quality settings, but the plugin will start optimizing images immediately after activation.

= Is my data secure? =

Yes, by default all processing happens locally on your server. Your media files never leave your WordPress installation unless you explicitly opt-in to our Pro cloud processing features.

= What's the difference between the free and Pro versions? =

The free version provides excellent local optimization. The Pro version (coming soon) will offer unlimited cloud processing, highest quality image and video compressions, CDN integration, and priority support for even better results.
